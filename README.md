# data-processor

This repository contains libraries that support parsing and validating data from a text file. 

It started as a POC for some ideas about importing data using a declarative way of defining the file specs. 
It is not ready yet, but if you often implement new file specifications in your projects and had asked whether there is a more productive way of doing it, you are not alone and I believe this is a good approach to consider, stay tuned. 

Even more, if you have ideas that you feel could be part of this project and you want to share and/or contribute you are welcome to do so.
